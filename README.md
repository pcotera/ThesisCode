Hi there!

Here you can find all the code and data from the experiments and the graphs used in my PhD thesis. 

The folders are arranged by the chapters in the thesis where the code is used. 

If you have any questions please send me an email at pablo.cotera@mail.utoronto.ca or visit www.pcotera.com

Hope this helps!
